## My Work
* [Datalift](https://github.com/theDeveloperShoon/DataLift): An exercise tracking and social sharing application for Android. This is made using modern techniques such as Coroutines and built using Jetpack Compose, Coil, JaCoCo and Roborazzi. 
* [D&D Battle Previewer](https://github.com/theDeveloperShoon/dnd-battle-previewer): An application that allows the user to preview battle initiative inside Dungeons and Dragons.  This is made using Electron JS
* [BlockPlacingGame(BPG)](https://github.com/theDeveloperShoon/BlockPlacingGame): A game made using the Unity Game Engine and C#.  This game was made to overcome the shortcomings of the game it is inspired off of.
